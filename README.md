Feeling bored?  Want to start a rousing game of [rock, paper, scissors, *catch*!](http://www.teachingideas.co.uk/pe/rockpaperscissorscatch.htm) but don’t have any pals around?  This one-player game of [rock, paper, scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors) will keep you entertained even if you don’t have anyone to play against (or even worse, anywhere to run around!).
